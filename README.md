<h2> Creating 3D urban planning web visualisations</h2>


👋 Hello, I'm Thomas, a passionate full-stack French developer.

🌍 My fascination for maps and urbanism have lead me to explore innovative methods of storytelling through web maps. </br>
Urban projects are long, complex, and imply a lot people, from different horizons. Inhabitants, architects, mayors ...
I would like to offer accessible 3D representations of projects so everyone understands at their own level what's being planned. </br>
It may be a first step towards a better appropriations of one's neighborhood, town or city.

⛰️ Beyond architecture and urbanism, I believe every project could benefit from maps, whatever its field. </br>
That's why I am also working on other 3D webmapping projects, to help people visualise things on a map, and how they organise themselves in space.

⚡️ Join me on GitHub to stay updated on my projects and join my passion for 3D webmapping.
